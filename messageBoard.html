    <p>SpongeBob SquarePants (or simply SpongeBob) is an American animated comedy television
        series created by marine science educator and animator Stephen Hillenburg 
        for Nickelodeon. The series chronicles the adventures of the title character and his 
        aquatic friends in the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom. 
        Being the fifth-longest-running American animated series, its high popularity has made 
        it a media franchise. It is the highest rated series to air on Nickelodeon
        as well as the most profitable property for Paramount Consumer Products, having generated
        over $13 billion in merchandising revenue as of 2019.
